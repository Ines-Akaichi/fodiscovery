# Discovering Reliable Functional Dependencies

This is the implementation for discovering reliable dependencies from data using the reliable fraction of information. For more information you can check the following papers:
- Discovering Reliable Dependencies from Data: Hardness and Improved Algorithms, Mandros, Boley, Vreeken, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'18) 
- Discovering Reliable Approximate Functional Dependencies , Mandros, Boley, Vreeken, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD conference (KDDâ€™17)

## How to run

To discover reliable dependencies in data, refer to the readme.txt file

## Info
